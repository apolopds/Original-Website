        Hello everyone! I’m here to share my insights from our midterm lessons about the Internet and the World Wide Web.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned that the internet connects many smaller networks around the world and works through servers, clients, and IP addresses to send information.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also learned about the difference between narrowband and broadband — narrowband is slow and outdated, while broadband is the fast internet we use today from providers like PLDT and Globe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Computer Hardware Components
        Computer hardware includes all the physical parts like the CPU, memory, and storage.
        I learned how these parts work together to make the computer run properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Classification and Function of Hardware and Software
        Hardware performs actions while software gives instructions.
        Both are important because they depend on each other to work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Integration of Hardware and Software
        Hardware acts as the body, and software is the brain that controls it.
        When they work together, the computer functions smoothly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The World Wide Web is not the same as the internet — it’s just one part where we can browse, watch videos, and read pages through browsers.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many ways to communicate online like email, messaging, video calls, and social media, which make sharing information easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also realized how powerful the internet is for business, learning, and entertainment — but it can be risky because of threats like phishing, spamming, and spyware.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, I learned that the internet is very useful, but we must use it wisely and safely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for listening!
      </p>
